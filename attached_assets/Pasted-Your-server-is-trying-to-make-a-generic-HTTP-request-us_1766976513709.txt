Your server is trying to make a generic HTTP request (using a tool called Ky) to cleanup old files, and that specific request is failing SSL validation.

The error is happening in a function called cleanupOldArchivedPdfs. When this cleanup task fails, it crashes the entire server because it doesn't have a "safety net" (try/catch block).
